      I believe education is one of the most important factors to create a healthy society, because if we don't know about a certain topic very much we cannot even discuss it, agree with it, or disagree with it.

      Unfortunately, we are not well educated about money â€”I mean, not how to earn money but what money is actually. Our school curriculum is basically favorable for our government, so we are not taught about what's going on in the financial system we've been living in.

      We need learn about money in order to create an alternative society within spiritual community.
