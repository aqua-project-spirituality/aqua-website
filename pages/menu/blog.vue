          <p class="note">
            I'm writing this blog to the future readers for now; I've not yet launched this blog site on the internet. So why am I writing this right now? Well, I'm writing as a promise with myself that I will manifest what I'm currently working on —i.e. <em><strong>aqua</strong></em>, the social platform for spiritual community in New Earth. I truly feel and believe that such social platform like aqua using cryptocurrency will be needed by the world and people in near future. I foresee the future world where each community or group will come to have their own platform with their own currency. Spiritual community won't be an exception.

            Today, I talked with my spiritual teacher, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritualCatalyst" target="_blank">Teal Swan</a>, for the first time in my life. Though it was not a talk in person but on the internet, talking with her was really special moment for me,because I've been following her over these three years. I've learned a lot from her about life and the universe, and basically she saved my soul. After the talk now, I intuitively feel that the fact that I could share same reality and time with her is the confirmation from the universe that the path I'm currently walking is correct, and I've become more motivated to express my mission in English. Truly amazing and encouraging time for me!

            <h2 class="post-title">From Old to New</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            I'm writing this in July 2020. People seem to restart their nomal lives as quarantine time is over. But I'm firmly convinced that we are never going to the lives before the pandemic, because in the coming months and a few years, a massive economic crisis will occur on a global scale. An economic crisis that we've never experienced before in our life time. You will notice this is inevitable if you study and dig into what money is actually all about and what our nation-state governments have done to our money for a long time. Not just because of the virus things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this sounds scary, I believe the coming crisis is necessary for our world to shift from <em>negative</em> to <em>positive</em>, from <em>old</em> to <em><strong>a New Earth</strong></em>. Necessary to achieve collective "ascension" on this planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, the coming crisis will destruct nation-states monetary system we are used to for a long time. The system is known as <em>fiat currency</em> sysytem, in which our governments have controlled our money, either you are in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Japan, or South Africa. While this existing economic system is going to collapse globally, a new structure will emerge ––that is, <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>-based economic system. Yes, like Bitcoin. (You may have heard about Bitcoin before). In this new system, anyone or any group or any community can create their own currency that is reliable, secured by cryptography. I intend that <em>aqua</em> will be one of them for spiritul community. I don't have enough space to explain here what cryptocurrency is all about, but in short <strong>cryptocurrency will bring much more freedom to our society</strong>.

              In case you are interested in cryptocurrency and what has been a deep problem about our monetary system controlled by governments, I recommend checking the following:

            All in all, the year 2020 is a tipping point for humanity. I believe our world is heading towards much better place anyway. We need destruct <em>the old</em> and build <em>a new</em>. I'm really excited about our near future.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
            P.S. From astrological viewpoint, 2020 is a truly significant time; Pluto and Saturn joined in Capricorn in January 2020. This configuration tells us that the existing social structure that doesn't serve us any longer will collapse, and a new social structure will emerge.

          </div>
          <p>
            We are all <em>The Magician</em>. We are an infinite being. Since each one of us is <em>The Magician</em>, we can create whatever we want in this universe. We can manifest whatever we want like <em>The Magician</em> does on the card. Many of us just have forgotten this fact for a long time; we have lost touch with our higher self.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now in the Age of Aquarius, it's time for every one of us to retrieve our own <em>Magician</em> within oursleves.
