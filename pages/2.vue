    Awakening but Feeling really lonely?

    <p>
      If so, this site is for you because I am a person who feels same. (English is not my native language so please bear with me if mistakes found. But I believe I have something valuable to say for those who are going through their own awakening journey.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply put, I would like to create a place where people who are spiritually awakening but feel lonely can gather and connect each other. Because that is a kind of place I always want.

    <p>
      But it is not just a place like a Facebook group page. I'd like to create a small “society” within our place. How? Using Crypto. Have you heard about Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin? As I am a programmer, I'm convinced that Crypto is our humanity future, and every community will eventually use Crypto to create an alternative society. Yes, at this point, few people notice the potential but Crypto has been getting popular recently.

      Lastly, I leave a quote from my best spiritual teacher, Teal Swan. Thanks for your reading! Wish light comes into your life.

      "Today, I have a message for you.  And that message is, you are not alone.  There has never been a second that you were alone.  There will never be a second that you are alone.  When you came down to this physical life, you came so that source (which is in fact the greater part of you) could come to know itself through your eyes.  You agreed to the perspective of separation so that source could come to know and understand the nature of it's own "oneness" through your eyes.  Perspective is only one angle of truth.  And the real truth is that truth is far more comprehensive than that one angle.  Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there.  Remember this when you are observing the stark absence of friendship in your life.  Remember this when you are feeling lonely or misunderstood...  Behind the veil of your limited perspective, we are there.  Your isolation, is merely an illusion.  And by far the greater part of this universe and world not only understands you and not only loves you, but also, IS you."
